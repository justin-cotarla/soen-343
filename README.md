SOEN 343 - Team 3 Repo

## Development Setup
1. Install Docker
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/justin-cotarla/soen-343.git`
3. Start Docker from the project root and enter: `docker-compose up --build`

### Front-End Setup

The development of the frontend is found within the folder /frontend. This project is built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. Install the latest version of Node.js 8. The installation includes the package manager known as `npm`.
2. cd to /frontend from the project root.
3. When dependencies change or when accessing the folder for the first time, enter `npm install`.
4. To start react, enter `npm start` in the /frontend folder. 
5. The server should be running on `localhost:3000`. To stop the server, simply press CTRL + C in the shell.

The react-app is meant to be running simultaneously with the backend server, where the backend server will be running on a separate shell.
